TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  


SERVICE PROVIDED

AirMax Internet L.L.C. ("Provider") agrees to furnish the Client with the selected package of Wireless Internet Access Service as agreed upon at the time of installation. The Provider will deliver the service with reasonable care and skill in accordance with industry standards.

TERM OF AGREEMENT

This Agreement remains in effect from the start of service and continues as long as the service is provided. The Client may cancel the service at any time, but must notify AirMax Internet L.L.C. at least 10 days in advance of the intended cancellation date. This advance notice is required to give AirMax Internet L.L.C. sufficient time to stop any invoices and prevent further charges. AirMax Internet L.L.C. retains ownership of all equipment, antennas, cables, and select software. Upon termination of service, all equipment must be promptly returned to AirMax Internet L.L.C. Failure to return the equipment will result in a charge of $100.00 per unit, which will be billed to the Client. 

PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Client may choose to be billed monthly for the selected Wireless Internet Access Service. AirMax Internet L.L.C. reserves the right to request payment for all equipment associated with the initial installation in advance. Service charges are due on the service commencement date. Failure to pay by the due date may result in temporary disconnection of service.  
  
The Client has full control over their billing account and is responsible for ensuring that all invoices are paid on time. If the Client activates autopay on their account, the system will automatically process any due invoices on the scheduled payment date. It is the Client’s responsibility to maintain accurate payment information and ensure sufficient funds are available for the processing of payments. AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not liable for any service disruptions resulting from failed payments due to insufficient funds, expired payment methods, or any other issue related to the Client's billing account.  
  
By enabling autopay, the Client agrees to allow AirMax Internet L.L.C. to process payments for any due or past-due invoices without further notice. The Client understands that failure to address outstanding balances may result in service interruption until the account is brought current.

POLICY FOR OVERDUE PAYMENTS AND RECONNECTION

If a client’s invoice remains unpaid for more than 10 days past the due date, Airmax will arrange for the pickup of antennas and routers. After the equipment is picked up, a $25.00 reconnection fee, along with all outstanding invoices, must be paid in full before service can be reinstated. Failure to settle the reconnection fee and outstanding balance will result in permanent disconnection.

CHANGES TO SERVICE

The Client may request to change their Wireless Internet Access package or speed without violating the terms of this agreement. No fee will be charged for changes to the service package. However, relocating the service to a new address will incur a minimum fee of $100.00. No early termination fees apply, but all outstanding balances must be settled prior to service termination or transfer.

REFUND POLICY

AirMax Internet L.L.C. strives to provide the best service experience possible. However, no refunds or account credits will be issued for service interruptions due to weather conditions or power outages. Exceptions may be considered for extended service interruptions only if it is determined that the cause was not related to weather damage. The decision to issue any refund or credit is at the sole discretion of AirMax Internet L.L.C.

CLIENT INSTALLATION

The installation date and time will be determined by AirMax Internet L.L.C. and communicated to the Client as early as possible. Before or during installation, AirMax Internet L.L.C. will verify whether the Client’s computer(s) are appropriately configured for the Wireless Internet Access Service. If additional hardware is needed for the service to function correctly, the Client must purchase or provide the necessary equipment. AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not responsible for any issues that arise from the Client’s internal network setup or from using the provided Wireless Internet Access Service Router. Service calls related to computer or network problems will incur a fee, which the Client must pay.

EQUIPMENT OWNERSHIP AND REMOVAL POLICY

AirMax Internet L.L.C. retains full ownership of all equipment provided to clients, including but not limited to antennas, routers, and other telecommunications hardware. The following conditions apply regarding the access, removal, and ownership of such equipment:  
  
Authorized Access: AirMax Internet L.L.C. personnel or authorized contractors are permitted to access, repair, or replace company-owned equipment at any time as needed to maintain service quality. Access will typically be arranged with the client; however, AirMax reserves the right to enter the premises for equipment-related issues.  
  
Service Cancellation: Upon cancellation or termination of service, AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not required to seek further permission from the client to remove its equipment. The company retains the right to retrieve any installed equipment from the client's property, whether or not the client is present or has provided access.  
  
Client Responsibility for Access: Clients are responsible for providing AirMax Internet L.L.C. with the necessary access to the premises to retrieve equipment upon service termination. In cases where the property is locked or inaccessible, AirMax may remove equipment as needed or reschedule removal at the client’s expense.  
  
Unauthorized Equipment Use: Clients are prohibited from using, relocating, or tampering with AirMax Internet L.L.C.'s equipment after service cancellation. Any such actions may result in additional fees or legal action.

STORM DAMAGES

AirMax Internet L.L.C. is dedicated to maintaining continuous service. However, in the event of electrical storms, service interruptions may occur due to damage to our infrastructure. AirMax Internet L.L.C. is committed to restoring services within 24 hours, weather permitting, and will make every effort to complete repairs within 48 hours. The Provider is not liable for service interruptions caused by severe weather conditions beyond its control.

WIRELESS ROUTER WARRANTY

AirMax Internet L.L.C. provides each client with a basic WiFi Wireless Router at no additional cost. The warranty for router exchange or replacement is valid for 30 days from the installation date. AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not responsible for malfunctions due to manufacturing defects, electrostatic discharge (ESD), electrical storms, or any other related issues. If technical support determines that the Client’s Wireless Router is defective, the Client must purchase a new router from a retail store or from AirMax Internet L.L.C. before a service call can be scheduled. The Client is responsible for ensuring the functionality of their router post-installation.

SERVICE OBSTRUCTION BY TREES

Clients are advised to maintain their property, including keeping trees pruned and removing any foliage or branches that may obstruct the wireless signal. AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not responsible for maintaining a clear signal path. It is the Client’s responsibility to ensure that the installation site remains free from obstructions that could impact service quality.

CLIENT-PROVIDED EQUIPMENT

Any equipment not purchased from AirMax Internet L.L.C. is considered client-provided equipment. AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not responsible for supporting client-provided equipment. The Client will be liable for service call expenses if such equipment adversely affects the Wireless Internet Access Service. It is the Client’s responsibility to ensure that their equipment is compatible with the service provided.

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES

AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not liable for any incidental or consequential damages resulting from the failure or suspension of Wireless Internet Access services. This includes but is not limited to, loss of data, loss of revenue, or any other damages resulting from service interruptions.

SERVICE CALLS

Service calls are generally free; however, there will be a charge of $1.50 per foot for replacing damaged cables unless the Client has AirMax Protection Insurance. The manufacturer warrants the provided Wireless Internet Access Point/Router for one (1) year. During this period, AirMax Internet L.L.C. will support the hardware for problems covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Service calls related to out-of-warranty routers will be charged to the Client at the prevailing rates.

SERVICE DELIVERY

Wireless Internet Access connection speeds (50Mbps to 200+Mbps, depending on the package chosen) are measured between the Client’s location and the AirMax Internet L.L.C. access point. Speeds may vary due to high Internet usage, and actual data transmission rates may be lower due to factors such as Internet congestion, server or router speeds, protocol overheads, and other conditions beyond AirMax Internet L.L.C.’s control. The Provider does not guarantee uninterrupted service or specific connection speeds.

INSTALLATION DELAY

AirMax Internet L.L.C. is not liable for any delays in the delivery or installation of Wireless Internet Access Service, nor for any damages suffered by the Client due to such delays. Delays may occur due to factors beyond the Provider's control, and AirMax Internet L.L.C. will make reasonable efforts to minimize such delays.

EXCESSIVE USE POLICY

AirMax Internet L.L.C. enforces an Excessive Use Policy to ensure fair usage of the network. While the vast majority of Clients use their connection responsibly, an extremely small percentage may engage in excessive use that negatively impacts other Clients. In such cases, AirMax Internet L.L.C. reserves the right to throttle the network speed of any Client who exceeds fair usage limits. This policy is rarely enforced and is intended to maintain service quality for all Clients.

Our Network Operations Center (NOC) Engineers proactively monitor network performance to ensure adequate bandwidth is available for all Clients.
